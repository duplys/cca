Components expected to be volatile must not be depended on by components that are difficult to change (otherwise, the volatile component will be de facto difficult to change).\n",
        "\n",
        "One sure way&mdash;besides size, complexity, clarity, etc.&mdash;to make a software component difficult to change is to make lots of other software components depend on it. A component with lots of incoming dependencies is very stable because it requires a great deal of work to reconcile any changes with all the dependent components.\n",

On the other hand, it says that an unstable component should be concrete since its instability allows the concrete code within it to be easily changed.\n",
